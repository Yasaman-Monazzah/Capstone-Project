## Loan Default Prediction Project

### The Problem AreThe focus of this project is analyzing loan default status, aiming to understand the factors that contribute to loan defaults and predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. . This is crucial because when loans aren't paid back, it causes financial losses for banks and lending companies, impacting their stability and ability to help others.rs.

### The User
Banks and lending companies are directly affected by loan defaults. By identifying borrowers who may face difficulties in repayment, they can make better decisions about who to lend money to, ultimately minimizing losses and ensuring fair access to credit.

### The Big Idea
The id, we can detect patterns that indicate higher risk o so the banks can either refuse the loan, lowering the loan amount, or raising the interest rate. default.

#### �Modeling is going to be performedexperimented with various machine learning models, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoosAccurately predicting loan defaults can lead to significant savings for banks and lending institutions, typically ranging from 10% to 30% or more of total losses incurred due to unpaid loans, depending on factors like institution size, predictive model quality, and risk management effectiveness.s from unpaid loans. Additionally, it can promote fairness in lending practices, ensuring that those who can repay are approved for loans while protecting against those who may struggle.

### The Data
The dataset used for analysis is obtained from Kaggle: [Loan Defaulter Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakitus (Fully Paid, Charged Off, etc.)

We will perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to prepare the data for modeling. Then, we will train machine learning models to predict loan default status based on the provided features. on further improving the model’s performance and interpretability.
